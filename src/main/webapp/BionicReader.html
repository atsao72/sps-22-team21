              <p class="font-weight-dark">Bionic Reading is a reading system that supports the readers flow.
                The eye is guided through the text by means of typographic highlights.
                With the interplay of fixations and the rapid movement between fixation points
                The readers visual stimuli can be transferred to the text.</p>            </div>

              <h2 class="font-weight-bold">Who is Bionic Reading for?</h2>
              <p class="font-weight-dark">Though Bionic Reading was developed for anyone who has been diagnosed with or identifies with Neurodivergency,
                Many who identify with conditions such as ADHD or Dyslexia have found that Bionic Reading improves their reading comprehension.
                Though Bionic Reading has helped indivuals with Neurodivergencies, BR is for anyone who finds this method easier to read!</p>

              <h4 class="font-weight-bold">My Experience</h4>
              <p class="font-weight-dark">This past year I was diagnosed with ADHD, which meant that I had trouble focusing and had trouble reading books with large blocks of text
                Every time I sat to read a book or any blocks of text I was met with distractions from everything that surrounded me
                I always wanted to read a book the whole way through and was only able to read books that used highly typographical text such as "House Of Leaves" by Mark Z Danielewski
                Though it may seem difficult to read for a person who does not have a neurodivergent condition, text like the one below."
                It may seem like a complicated way to read, but the complex and more involved style of text helps in keeping the neurodivergent reader interested
                In Bionic Reading, I have found it easier to comprehend and stay engaged in what I am reading with the typographic highlights guiding my eyes
                I am able to stay focused and continue reading!</p></div>
