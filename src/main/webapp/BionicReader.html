        <h2>What is Bionic Reading?</h2>
        <p>Bionic Reading is a reading system that supports the readers flow.</p>
        <p>The eye is guided through the text by means of typographic highlights.</p>
        <p>With the interplay of fixations and the rapid movement between fixation points</p>
        <p>The readers visual stimuli can be transferred to the text.</p>

            <h3>Who is Bionic reading for?</h3> 
                <p>Though Bionic Reading was developed for anyone who has been diagnosed with or identifies with Neurodivergency,</p>
                <p>Many who identify with conditions such as ADHD or Dyslexia have found that Bionic Reading improves their reading comprehension.</p>
                <p>Though Bionic Reading has helped indivuals with Neurodivergencies, BR is for anyone who finds this method easier to read!</p>
            <h4>My Experience</h4>
                <p>This past year I was diagnosed with ADHD, which meant that I had trouble focusing and had trouble reading books with large blocks of text</p>
                <p>Every time I sat to read a book or any blocks of text I was met with distractions from everything that surrounded me</p>
                <p>I always wanted to read a book the whole way through and was only able to read books that used highly typographical text such as "House Of Leaves" by Mark Z Danielewski</p>
                <p>Though it may seem difficult to read for a person who does not have a neurodivergent condition, text like the one below."</p>
                <p>It may seem like a complicated way to read, but the complex and more involved style of text helps in keeping the neurodivergent reader interested</p>
                <p>In Bionic Reading, I have found it easier to comprehend and stay engaged in what I am reading with the typographic highlights guiding my eyes</p>
                <p>I am able to stay focused and continue reading!</p>
